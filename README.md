# Fitbit.Clockface.One

_The code in this repository is developed with [Fitbit Studio](https://dev.fitbit.com/getting-started/)._

This clockface is inspired by [Clear Beam](https://github.com/viper3400/ClearBeam), a clockface which was marked as discontinued by it's developer in 2019 and is not available for latest Fitibit watches. Though, JaxxOne has not (and never will have) all the customization possibilites of its role model.

It displays the 
- weekday,
- current hours, minutes incl. seconds,
- the date plus month on the right side

It displays todays
- steps, 
- calories, 
- floors, 
- azm, 
- current heart rate
at the left side 

- On tap, todays values are replaced with the daily goals for the values 
- Heart rate will show the daily rest heart rate
- Goals will disapear after 6 seconds without tap

Not implemented yet:
- Gray bars under each value fill with color from 0 to 100% of the daily goal
- Display of battery load, warning on low battery

If you encounter any issues, you may report it here: https://github.com/viper3400/Fitbit.Clockface.One/issues

This clockface needs permission for activity (to get the daily goals) and heart rate tracking.

You may use this clockface for free as it is. Please respect, that this is a private project and that this clockface hast just to fullfill my personal needs.
